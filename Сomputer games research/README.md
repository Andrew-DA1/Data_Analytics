## Challenges
Context<br/>
We are conducting research for an online store that sells computer games around the world.<br/>
Historical data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres, and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available from open sources.<br/>
We need to identify patterns that determine the success of the game.<br/> 
This will allow you to place a bet on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.<br/> 
We have data before 2016. Imagine that it is December 2016, and we are planning a campaign for 2017.<br/> 
You need to work out the principle of working with data.<br/> 
The data set includes the abbreviation ESRB — Entertainment Software Rating Board) - an association that determines the age rating of computer games.<br/> 
ESRB evaluates game content and assigns it a suitable age category, for example, "For adults", "For young children" or "For teenagers".<br/>
